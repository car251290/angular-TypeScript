# Battaleface

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Prerequisites
To get the most out of this tutorial you should already have a basic understanding of the following.

# HTML
# JavaScript
# TypeScript

# Simple deployment options
Before fully deploying your application, you can test the process, build configuration, and deployed behavior by using one of these interim techniques.

Building and serving from disk
During development, you typically use the ng serve command to build, watch, and serve the application from local memory, using webpack-dev-server. When you are ready to deploy, however, you must use the ng build command to build the application and deploy the build artifacts elsewhere.

Both ng build and ng serve clear the output folder before they build the project, but only the ng build command writes the generated build artifacts to the output folder.
